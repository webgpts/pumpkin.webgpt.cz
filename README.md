> Czech Priest's Halloween Pumpkin Stomping Incident in Kurdejov



In 2018, a Czech priest caused an uproar when he posted a video online of himself stomping pumpkins placed outside the door of a local church.  

The incident has been met with widespread condemnation, with one Czech bishop calling the priest's conduct "highly inappropriate” and “a sort of symbolism that breaks the understanding of the Church". 

The priest later publicly apologized for his actions, claiming that he was being sarcastic and not trying to cause offense.

The incident has highlighted a divide between the Roman Catholic Church’s more traditional elements and its progressive members, with some arguing that it indicates an unhealthy focus on puritanical interpretations of Christianity.


## Conclusion

The incident in Kurdejov shows both the lack of understanding of modern religious customs and the importance of understanding the symbolism of certain actions in different contexts. It is clear that the priest’s behavior was wrong and that an apology was warranted but, by the same token, it has opened up an important conversation about the direction the church is taking and the extent of involvement from its most conservative members.
